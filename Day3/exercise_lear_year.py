# Leap year method;

# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
#   **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
